This project is a simple implementation of a ball and a paddle game, by using openCV and pygame of python.
<br>
Features of the game:
1. You can move the pedal below with the help of some specifically coloured objects (some shades of blue and green, as initially added into the code).
2. The pedal will move at that specific position where the coloured object is detected.
3. The coloured object is detected with the help of the camera and footage is shown in the background of the game. So, it becomes easy for the user to move the pedal.
4. The range of the colours to be detected can be scaled or changed in the code.
5. The score is displayed on the top of the window.
6. A hitting sound is also produced when the ball hits the bricks above.
